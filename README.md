## About

While reading this book I had a thought about implementations of algorithms in languages other than Python. As training I've decided to make it myself. Here you can see the result in C#. 

## Structure

In a directory called Algorithms you can find a class library with algorithms implementation. One class - one algorithm.

The second directory contains a console program that tests algorithms.
